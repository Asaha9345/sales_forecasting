## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow (Keras)

## Data Description
The project utilizes the following datasets:
- **items.csv**: Contains details about items available in the restaurants.
- **restaurants.csv**: Contains information about various restaurants.
- **sales.csv**: Contains historical sales data for the restaurants.

## Usage
1. Load the datasets into the Python environment:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   items = pd.read_csv('items.csv')
   restaurants = pd.read_csv('restaurants.csv')
   sales = pd.read_csv('sales.csv')
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform data analysis and train the models.

## Models Implemented
The following machine learning models are implemented for sales forecasting:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network**

## Results
The results of the models are evaluated using metrics such as RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The best-performing model will be highlighted in the analysis section of the notebook.
